# surface-analysis
This is a collection of the matlab tools that I have developed to process and analyse my data (I am sitll in the process of adding everything to this repository and providing helpful descriptions and instructions).
Most of my experimental work is with atomic force microscopy, so these scripts are typically used for processing images, or taking 0D time-domain data (i.e. a scan of zero size, in which the area maps to time) and converting them into better visualisations.
I have also worked with secondary ion mass spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and have produced processing/analytical tools for these types of data.
The scripts for use with atomic force microscopy data were created for use with Bruker/Veeco Nanoscope files, although they may be generalised to any ascii data, with some modification to the expected column titles and header lines.
