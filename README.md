This is a collection of the matlab tools that I have developed to process and analyse my data.
Most of my experimental work is with atomic force microscopy, so these scripts are typically used for processing images, or taking 2D time-domain data and converting them into better visualisations.
I have also worked with secondary ion mass spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and have produced processing/analytical tools for these types of data.
